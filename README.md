 # <landing-page-anime>
 #### This project is for practice and firm what I learned on the async course that platzi gave to his students.

 <div style="text-align:center">

 ## - <span style="color:#1ADF61;">Info about the page</span>

 ##### At the moment you can only search animes and is made for mobile more specific for screens that have 375 width and 667 height approximate , could work in screenshot higher than those but some things are gonna broke.


 ## - <span style="color:#1ADF61;">Screenshot and a short video</span>
 ##### This is how it looks the directory, probably in the future I'm gonna make some changes so at the moment is gonna stay like that

- Add a filter for search
- Add a pagination
- make a page for each anime
