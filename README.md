##### I made this page with api [<a href="">Jikan</a>](https://jikan.moe)


 ![Hello welcome to this repository](./src/assets/img/readMeImgs/LuffyGif.gif)

 # <landing-page-anime>
 #### This project is for practice and firm what I learned on the async course that platzi gave to his students.

 <div style="text-align:center">

 ## - <span style="color:#1ADF61;">Info about the page</span>

 ##### ~~At the moment you can only search animes and is made for mobile more specific for screens that have 375 width and 667 height approximate, could work in screenshot higher than those but some things are gonna broke~~.<p style="color:green">I made responsive almost all the mobile screens and some desktop. Also I made the landing page that's for now is the home page</p>


 ## - <span style="color:#1ADF61;">Screenshot and a short video</span>
 ##### This is how it looks the directory, probably in the future I'm gonna make some changes so at the moment is gonna stay like that

##### this section show seven new animes with their names and you can change doing click on the arrow (I put background-repeat: repeat-x because the background image lost too much quality)
